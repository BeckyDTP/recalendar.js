# ReCalendar
### Highly customizable calendar for ReMarkable tablets

ReCalendar allows you to generate your own, personalized calendar right in your browser. It's still WIP, but should be production ready mid-December.

It is the continuation of my previous efforts: https://github.com/klimeryk/recalendar. Although, basically all of the code had to be rewritten as I'm using a different PDF library, CSS engine, language, etc.

## Features

 - Optimized for the [ReMarkable 2 tablet](https://remarkable.com/store/remarkable-2) (should work with version 1 as well) to use the full space available and minimize screen refreshes.
 - No hacks needed - the generated PDF is a normal file, with links, etc. that you can simply upload normally to your tablet.
 - Heavy use of links to allow quick and easy navigation.
 - Lots of easy configuration options to tailor the calendar to your needs - plus access to the source code for even more advanced customization.
 - Easily switch to any locale supported by PHP.
 - Add extra pages to all or selected days of the week to suit your needs.
 - Provide a list of special dates (anniversaries, birthdays, etc.) and let ReCalendar embed them into your personalized calendar - on monthly views, weekly overviews and finally, day entries.
 - Track your habits monthly.
 - Start the "year" on arbitrary month (can be useful for tracking academic years, etc.).

## Quickstart for developers/contributors

The usual dance, using `yarn`:
```
yarn install
yarn start
```

This should automatically open http://localhost:3000/ in your default browser.

## Known issues

### It's slow to generate

The preview should be fairly quick - a few seconds. The preview covers only the first month. Generating the full calendar takes at least 12 times that ;) I've seen best performance from Chrome-based browsers. For some reason, Firefox (which is my primary browser) does not like handling large PDF blobs. But I've tried to make it work there as well.

### It does not cover the full page on my XYZ tablet/device

I only have ReMarkable 2 to test with and I wanted to take up all the available space on the screen for it. So it's been optimized for RM2's screen size. Please open a new issue if you think your device could benefit from this calendar!
